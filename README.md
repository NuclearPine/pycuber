# Pycuber - a simple TUI app for 3x3 Rubik's cube speedsolving practice.

Inspired by [csTimer](https://cstimer.net). Built with the [Textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual/) framework.

Scrambles are generated via a random-state generation method which is then solved via Kociemba's algorithm.
